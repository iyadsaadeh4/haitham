## Python Currency Converter

This is a simple GUI application that you can develop using Python. As you can guess by the name, you will build a currency converter that can convert currencies from one unit to another, for example, converting Indian rupee into pound or euro.

The design of this application will be straightforward â€“ the main focus should be the primary function, that is, converting currency units from one to another. You can use **Tkinter**, the standard Python interface to the **Tk GUI toolkit** shipped along with Python.

Requirements:

* The user should see a nice looking GUI.  
* The user should be able to choose which currency he need to convert from.
* The user should be able to choose which currency he need to convert to.
* The user should be able to convert the currency with the lates exchange rate.

NOTE: please follow this API or any API to exchange rates [exchange rate api](https://exchangeratesapi.io/).
