# Python second Project

## Python Youtube Downloader

You will be building a YouTube downloader in Python3 using the PyTube3 library. The original pytube library no
longer works and so you need to use the pytube3 library which only works with Python3 and not with Python2.

Requirements:

* The user should be able to enter a link for the video to download.
* The user should be able to specify the directory in which the video will be downloaded.
* The user should be able to delete any video downloaded by the program.
* The user should be able to see a message when the video link is invalid.
